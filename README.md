## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML was used to structure the page, and the CSS was used to style the page and make it responsive. The JavaScript was used to handle the game logic, including keeping track of the user's choice, generating the computer's choice, and determining the winner of the game.

The game uses event listeners to detect when the user clicks on one of the three buttons for rock, paper, or scissor. When a button is clicked, the corresponding choice is saved and the computer's choice is generated randomly. The two choices are then compared to determine the winner of the game, and the result is displayed on the screen.

The game also includes animations and sound effects to enhance the user experience. When the user clicks on a button, the button is highlighted, and an animation is played to simulate the movement of the hand. When the game is over, a sound effect is played to indicate the result of the game.

Overall, the Rock Paper and Scissor game is a simple but fun project that showcases the power and flexibility of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating engaging and interactive web applications.


<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

Regardless of your level of experience, being an engineer involves constantly learning. Whenever you create something, you will always experience moments of excitement and accomplishment, such as feeling amazed by what you have built or feeling a sense of pride and satisfaction.
